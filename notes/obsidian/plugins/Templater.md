# ðŸ”Œ Templater ðŸ”Œ
[Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) is a template plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/). It defines a templating language that lets you insert variables and functions results into your notes. It will also let you execute JavaScript code manipulating those variables and functions.

Templates live in the `extras/templates` folder and represent the concept of Content Types. I've found it helpful to represent the things that I think about as content types with structured meta data so that they can be organized appropriately.
# Hotkeys
- mapped "Templater: Create new note from template" from `Alt + N` to `Ctrl + N`
- mapped "Create new note" from `Ctrl + N` to `Alt + N`
# Configurations
-  Changed the **Template folder location** to `extras/templates`
# Templates
This is an overview of the templates in this knowledge management system.
- **Map** - A Map of Contents provides the ability to organize thoughts in a way that make sense to you. [A case for MOCs](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/a-case-for-mocs/2418) is a good general introduction.
- **Obsidian Plugin** - describes an [Obsidian Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins) that was used in this system.
