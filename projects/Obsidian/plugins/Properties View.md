# ðŸ”Œ Properties View ðŸ”Œ

The Properties view plugin adds two sidebar views that you can use to manage [Properties](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties):

- File properties â€” shows a view of the properties for the active note
- All properties â€” shows a list of all the properties in your vault and they type

## All properties view

With the "All properties" view you can:

- Sort properties by name or by frequency (total number of uses in your vault)
- Click a property to open [Search](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search) view with the [property search](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search#Search properties) syntax pre-filled
