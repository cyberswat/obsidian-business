# 🗺️ Obsidian MOC 🗺️

## 🔌Plugins🔌
An [Obsidian plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins) is an add-on module designed to extend the functionalities of the Obsidian note-taking app. Plugins can introduce new features, automate tasks, or integrate with other services. They can be official plugins developed by the Obsidian team, or community plugins contributed by users and developers. These plugins enhance the user experience by allowing customization based on individual needs and preferences.

I've documented each plugin that has been enabled to create this system.

```dataview 
TABLE description from #obsidian/plugin  
sort weight DESC, file.name ASC
```
## 🔌Concepts🔌

- **weight** - this is a property that is added to content types so that I can cause items to float above or below other items in data views that use sorting.
